# Predicting-Customer-Churn-in-the-Telecom-Sector-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Testing-Pipelines

**Introduction to the Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, originally published by IBM and made available on Kaggle by a user named Blastchar. It represents a fictional telecom company that offers phone and internet services to customers in California. The dataset includes details about customer demographics, the services they use, their contract type, billing information, and whether they eventually left the company (churned).

This dataset was designed to support research in churn prediction — a critical issue for businesses that rely on recurring customers. Understanding why customers leave helps companies design better retention strategies and improve their services.


**Research Questions**
How accurately can machine learning models predict customer churn based on demographic and service usage data?

How can automated testing improve the robustness and reliability of a churn prediction pipeline?

**Data Licensing and Usage**
This dataset is available under a CC0 (Public Domain) license. This means it's free to use, modify, and share without any legal restrictions. However, I will include proper acknowledgment in my GitHub repository to recognize the original data provider (IBM/Kaggle).

Additionally, my own code and work will be shared under an MIT License in the repository. This will allow others to freely use, modify, and build on the project while still crediting the original author.
