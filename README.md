# Predicting-Customer-Churn-in-the-Telecom-Sector-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Testing-Pipelines

**Introduction to the Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, originally published by IBM and made available on Kaggle by a user named Blastchar. It represents a fictional telecom company that offers phone and internet services to customers in California. The dataset includes details about customer demographics, the services they use, their contract type, billing information, and whether they eventually left the company (churned).

This dataset was designed to support research in churn prediction — a critical issue for businesses that rely on recurring customers. Understanding why customers leave helps companies design better retention strategies and improve their services.


**Research Questions**
How accurately can machine learning models predict customer churn based on demographic and service usage data?

How can automated testing improve the robustness and reliability of a churn prediction pipeline?
